어쩌구 저쩌구 내가 짱이다</a><strong>I'm a <u>boss</u></strong>
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop
You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss and my shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss and my shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss and my shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss and my shine like gloss</p>
